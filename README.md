# TF2 Config
These are the custom files I use in TF2. To add them to your game, just copy the files into the `tf/` directory with the same file structure as in the repository.

### Warning: .cfg files will change your settings
I highly recommend **NOT** copying and pasting the .cfg files. Instead, go through each file and make sure you know what each setting changes. In order for the startup.cfg to run at launch, you must add `-exec startup.cfg` to your TF2 launch options by clicking the gear icon, then `Properties` in your Steam library.
